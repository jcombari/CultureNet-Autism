# CultureNet 

CultureNet is a package for building generalized and culturalized deep models to estimate engagement levels from face images of autistic children. 

The baseline generalized deep models (GenNet) are deep convolutional networks composed of layers of the ResNet, a pre-trained deep network, as well as additional network layers. 

The culturalized deep models (CultureNet) follow the same architecture of GenNet; however, after training all layers with joint-culture data, the model freezes network parameters and use culture-specific data to fine-tune the last layer of the network.

## Deep Learning Models 

CultureNet consists of seven subject-independent and subject-dependent GenNet and CultureNet models, trained with within-culture, cross-culture, mixed-culture, and joint-culture data.
